    <span>Introduction</span>
    <span>In span this lab, we aimed to determine a method to find damage to a nerve cell to better diagnose and repair the damage without disrupting the surrounding healthy cells. This was modeled in the lab with two identical copper wires and a short connecting them at some unknown point along their length. The copper wire represented the axon of the neuron and the short represented the damage to the myelin sheath that would disrupt the flow of electrical charge through the neuron. Using current, resistance, and voltage of the two copper wires along different paths allowed us to determine the location of the short and would thus be used to determine the location of damage to the myelin sheath. This method used the concepts of Ohm�s law relating current, voltage, and resistance.</span>
